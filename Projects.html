									<h2>AFRL Research Competition</h2>
									<p>A team of myself and eight other students worked to develop an improved ejector nozzle to a </br>
									JetCat P100-RX turbine engine through thermodynamic and aerodynamic modeling, machining of </br>
									precision parts, and rigorous testing to improve thrust to weight ratio by a theoretical 68%.</p>

								<p>Throughout the course of my senior year, our team worked tirelessly to ensure a leading performance in the Air Force Research Laboratory competition. The challenge assigned to us by the AFRL was to improve the thrust to weight ratio of the JetCar P-100RX aircraft engine, without decreasing other performance parameters. As the engine is known to be temperamental, from numerous years of past use, our team determined a modification to the airflow geometry to be the both the least intrusive and safest possible modification to the engine. The design of an ejector nozzle was chosen as a novel solution, given its high theoretical thrust increase, minimal weight increase, and simplicity of manufacturing. The concepts of an ejector nozzle are similar to that of a bypass shell. The primary mass flow of the engine flows out of a converging nozzle and into the ejector nozzle mixing chamber. This primary mass flow entrains air from outside the engine, increasing total mass flow, and thus thrust, out of the back of the engine.</p>

								<p> The above thermodynamic model was generated through MATLAB, using data gathered from the JetCat engine without modification. The engine was wired with numerous type K thermocouples and pitot-static probes at crucial engine stations, in order to gather exceptionally accurate data to use in the standard jet engine equations. Assumptions were removed from the model as more data was collected, in order to refine and increase the precision of the model's thrust predictions. Incorporation of the additional ejector stage to the engine model was also done to increase precision, although academic and research resources on the ejector nozzle proved to be difficult to find. There is little to no empirical data on any physical ejector nozzles, leading us to use an iterative method of cold-gas testing through plastic 3D printed ejector nozzles to determine a best possible shape. Two large volume pressure tanks were used to replicate flow pressures leaving the engine. A series of ejector nozzles were attached to this test set up, where pressure data was taken in order to determine the optimal shape of the ejector for maximum thrust. The factors determined to be most important are maximizing air mixing within the ejector chamber and minimizing skin friction along the inside of the ejector chamber.</p>

								<p>Once the design was chosen and all dimensions were finalized within CAD, stress and deformation simulations were done to assess viability and necessary material requirements. These simulations assessed both thermal stresses and applied forces from the engine. Inconel was selected to be used as the material for the converging nozzle as it is capable of withstanding the flow temperatures, and it was able to be 3D printed on-site. Aluminum 6061-T6 was selected to compose the ejector chamber, as it proved to be light, affordable, and able to withstand the significantly lower stresses. </p>

								<p>Once the final design was selected, the converging nozzle was 3D printed with inconel and the ejector chamber was lathed out of aluminum. All 3D printing and lathing was done in-house to a tolerance of less than 0.025 millimeters. Following manufacturing of the entire ejector nozzle, the nozzle was assembled onto the engine for a test firing. A final value for thrust was not attained as difficulties arose during testing of the converging nozzle. A small fire started in the converging nozzle during testing, caused by an over-constriction of the flow, and thus incomplete dispersal and burning of the fuel.</p>

								<p> A past arduino project, done for my senior capstone, was the wiring and programming of two pitot-static, two thermocouple probes, and a load cell for both engine and cold gas testing. All probes were wired through and Arduino MEGA and data was logged onto an SD card during tests. A custom PCB shield was wired for ease of attachment to the arduino, allowing for simple switching of sensor set up between cold-gas, wind tunnel, and engine firing tests. Four analog signal ports with used for the pitot probe, with adequate switching time coded in for the ADC to reset between readings. The thermocouples and load cells used the PWM ports on the arduino and required no reset times between measurements. Data was encoded onto the SD card using four digital output pins on the Arduino to communicate with the module.</p>

								<p> A recent personal project of mine uses Arduino's PWM feature to control computer fans at a frequency of 25 kHz. The PWM ports of the Arduino naturally output a signal at 490 Hz and 980 Hz, although these can be modified to run up to 8 MHz. RPM information is gained from the fan's output wire, and converted from a binary signal into RPM within the code. A potentiometer was also added in order to control the speed, although a temperature sensor or light sensor could be used for differing purposes.</p>
